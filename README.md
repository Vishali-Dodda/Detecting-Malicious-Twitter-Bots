# 🕵️‍♂️ Detecting Malicious Twitter Bots Using Machine Learning  

## 📌 Overview  
This project aims to detect malicious Twitter bots using machine learning techniques. The system analyzes user profiles and tweet patterns to identify suspicious bot-like activity. The dataset includes Twitter user details and tweet information, which are processed and classified using logistic regression.  

## 🚀 Features  
- 📂 **Dataset Upload**: Load a dataset of Twitter users.  
- 🔍 **Module 1 - Extract Tweets**: Reads and displays tweet data.  
- 🤖 **Module 2 - Detect Bots**: Identifies bot accounts based on tweet content and user profile attributes.  
- 🌐 **Module 3 - Detect Malicious URLs**: Analyzes tweets containing URLs to identify potential malicious activity.  
- 📊 **Performance Metrics**: Evaluates accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC using logistic regression.  

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup  
1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies**  
   Ensure you have Python 3 installed and install the required libraries:  
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
   ```
3. **Run the Application**  
   ```bash
   python Main.py
   ```  

## 📁 Project Structure  
```
|-- Main.py         # GUI-based application for bot detection  
|-- test.py         # Test script to evaluate the model  
|-- kaggle_tweets.csv  # Dataset containing Twitter user details  
```

## 🧠 How It Works  
1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Extracts user details such as followers count, status count, and verification status.  
   - Tokenizes tweets and performs bag-of-words analysis to detect bot-like behavior.  
2. **Bot Detection Model**  
   - Uses **logistic regression** to classify users as bots or humans.  
   - Features include followers count, friends count, status count, and verified status.  
3. **URL-Based Malicious Activity Detection**  
   - Extracts URLs from tweets.  
   - Trains a model to detect malicious content based on tweet patterns.  
4. **Performance Evaluation**  
   - Computes **accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC** to measure model effectiveness.  

## 📈 Results & Metrics  
The logistic regression model achieves:  
✅ High **accuracy** in detecting bots.  
✅ Reliable **precision and recall** for classification.  
✅ A well-performing **ROC curve and AUC score**.
